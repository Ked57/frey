# Notes

What does this look like ?

- Define a schema with zod
- Define lists of possible params (filters, sorts, search, order)
- Define a function which retrieves this data with the params passed as args
- Define a function which deletes this data
- Define a function which creates this data
- Define a function which updates this data
- Define a function which defines ownership of this data (who can read, write, delete)

What does it do ?

- Explicitly define the structure of the data
- Handles the retrieval of the data
- Handles validation of the data
- Handles ownership of the data
- Exposes CRUD functions to be used by the application
- Exposes OpenAPI schema / Swagger documentation
- Exposes REST API endpoints and/or GraphQL API and/or
- Exposes a web interface for administration

# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Framework âœ… COMPLETED
- Entity definition with Zod schemas âœ…
- Route generation (GET /entity, GET /entity/:id) âœ…
- Type safety throughout âœ…
- Context injection (request, server) âœ…
- Basic CRUD operations âœ…
- Comprehensive testing suite âœ…
- CI/CD pipeline âœ…
- Tidy up CRUD by separating it in different files âœ…
- Custom routes âœ…
- Package publishing to npm âœ…
- TypeScript compilation to JavaScript âœ…
- Clean package distribution âœ…

## Phase 2: Ecosystem ðŸš§ NEXT
### Authentication & Security
- **JWT token validation middleware**: Validates JSON Web Tokens in request headers for stateless authentication
- **User context injection**: Automatically adds user info to request context for all route handlers
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Permissions based on user roles (admin, user, guest) with granular control
- **API key authentication**: Simple key-based authentication for third-party service integration

### Validation & Middleware
- **Enhanced parameter validation**: More sophisticated validation beyond basic Zod schemas with custom validators
- **Custom validation rules**: Domain-specific validation logic for business rules not expressible in schemas
- **Error message customization**: User-friendly error messages with internationalization support
- **Request/response middleware**: Intercept and modify requests/responses for logging, transformation, monitoring
- **Error handling standardization**: Consistent error responses across the API with standardized error codes

### Performance & Caching
- **Redis caching integration**: External cache storage for high performance and reduced database load
- **Memory caching layer**: In-memory cache for ultra-fast data access within the application
- **Cache invalidation strategies**: Smart cache management with TTL, event-based invalidation, and cache tags
- **Query optimization**: Efficient database queries with indexing, query analysis, and pagination
- **Rate limiting (per user/IP)**: Control request frequency to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- **CORS handling**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration for secure API access from web browsers

### Documentation & APIs
- **OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation**: Automatically generate OpenAPI 3.0 specs from entity definitions and routes
- **Interactive API explorer**: Built-in Swagger UI for testing and exploring the API endpoints
- **Admin dashboard**: Web interface for managing entities, viewing data, and monitoring API usage
- **API versioning**: Support for multiple API versions with backward compatibility and migration paths
- **SDK generation**: Generate client SDKs in multiple languages (TypeScript, Python, etc.) from API schema


## Phase 3: Developer Tools ðŸ”® FUTURE
### CLI & Tooling
- **CLI for scaffolding projects**: Command-line tool to generate project structure, entities, and boilerplate code
- **VS Code extension**: IDE integration with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and entity management
- **Development server with hot reload**: Live reloading during development with automatic restart on file changes
- **Testing utilities**: Helper functions and utilities for writing tests, mocking, and test data generation
- **Code generation tools**: Generate entity definitions, routes, and types from database schemas or OpenAPI specs

### Development Experience
- **Hot reload for development**: Automatic server restart and route re-registration during development
- **Debugging tools**: Enhanced logging, request tracing, and debugging utilities for development
- **Performance profiling**: Built-in performance monitoring and profiling tools for optimization
- **Error tracking integration**: Integration with error tracking services (Sentry, Bugsnag) for production monitoring

## Phase 4: Advanced Features ðŸ”® FUTURE
### Scalability & Performance
- **Advanced rate limiting**: Sophisticated rate limiting with sliding windows, burst handling, and dynamic limits
- **Microservices architecture**: Support for service discovery, inter-service communication, and distributed tracing
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics, latency tracking, and bottleneck identification

### Real-time & Advanced APIs
- **GraphQL integration**: GraphQL schema generation and resolvers from entity definitions
- **Real-time subscriptions (WebSocket)**: WebSocket support for real-time data updates and notifications
- **Server-sent events**: SSE support for one-way real-time communication from server to client
- **DOCP**
- **Advanced security features**: CSRF protection, security headers, input validation, and threat detection

### Observability & DevOps
- **Monitoring and observability**: Comprehensive monitoring with metrics, logs, and distributed tracing
- **Deployment tools**: Docker containers, Kubernetes manifests, and deployment automation
- **Health checks**: Built-in health check endpoints for load balancers and monitoring systems
- **Metrics collection**: Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring and alerting
- **Logging integration**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and log aggregation support
